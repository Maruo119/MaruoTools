The government has decided to send Foreign Minister Iwaya to the inauguration ceremony of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, scheduled to take place on the 20th of this month.  
According to government officials, the Trump side conveyed their intention to invite Foreign Minister Iwaya to the inauguration ceremony on the 20th.  
In response, the government decided to dispatch Minister Iwaya and informed the Trump team of its decision.  
Traditionally, Japan has sent its ambassador to the U.S. to attend American presidential inaugurations, making it unusual for a foreign minister to participate.  
The government is also exploring the possibility of arranging a meeting between Minister Iwaya and Marco Rubio, who is set to become Secretary of State, during Iwaya's visit to the U.S. Discussions are ongoing, taking into account the progress of Senate confirmation procedures necessary for cabinet appointments.  
Meanwhile, the government aims to arrange a summit meeting between Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump as soon as possible after Trump takes office.

Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has announced plans to provide financial support for overseas study expenses targeting young people such as university students.  
The specific subsidy amounts will be set based on the cost of living in the study destination. For short-term study programs (approximately 4 weeks to 3 months), up to 900,000 yen will be provided for travel and tuition fees.  
For medium- to long-term study programs (approximately 6 months to 1 year), up to 150,000 yen per month will be provided for living expenses, with a maximum total subsidy of 3.15 million yen for a one-year program, covering travel, tuition, and living expenses.  
The eligibility criteria are as follows:  
- The primary income earner (e.g., a parent) must reside in Tokyo.  
- The applicant must hold Japanese nationality and be enrolled in a university or technical college in Japan.  
There are no income restrictions for applicants.  
Additionally, the program primarily targets students seeking to study at overseas "universities," and language schools are excluded.  
According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the program aims to support approximately 500 short-term study abroad students and 100 medium- to long-term students annually. Applications and screenings will be conducted this year, with overseas dispatches starting in the summer of next year.  
On the 12th, Governor Koike explained the program, emphasizing its significance: "Japanâ€™s international competitiveness is declining, and the country is in a very subdued state. We must urgently foster talent that can thrive globally and accelerate investment in young people."  
Currently, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is conducting the governor's budget review for the fiscal year 2025. The budget allocates 100 million yen for the recruitment and screening process for this study abroad support program.  
The general account budget proposal for fiscal 2025 is expected to surpass the initial budget of 8.453 trillion yen for fiscal 2024, marking the largest scale in history.
