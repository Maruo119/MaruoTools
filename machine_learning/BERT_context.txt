The Tokyo metropolitan government will provide up to 100,000 yen in subsidies from October to residents of Tokyo who opt for painless deliveries, Governor Yuriko Koike has said.
"The Tokyo metropolitan government will lead efforts to realize a society where people can have and raise children without worry," Koike told reporters on Saturday.
It will be the country's first program to subsidize the cost of painless childbirths at the prefecture level.
The metropolitan government plans to allocate 1.1 billion yen for related expenses in its initial budget for fiscal 2025, and expects to provide subsidies for 9,500 painless delivery cases over the six months through the end of March next year.
Eligible medical institutions must meet certain safety standards.


Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Saturday agreed that Japan will provide the Southeast Asian nation with high-speed patrol boats.
At the day's meeting held at a presidential palace located on the outskirts of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, the two leaders also agreed to hold a so-called two-plus-two meeting of the two countries' foreign and defense ministers.
The two affirmed the importance of maintaining and strengthening an international order based on the rule of law.
Ishiba vowed to cooperate as much as possible in enhancing Indonesia's energy security and defense capabilities.
Noting that Japan is an extremely important partner, the Indonesian leader said that Ishiba's visit is a symbol of the strengthening of cooperation between the two nations in a wide range of areas.
